  <i>Hello Everyone, I'm Abinayaa Nagarajan. I hold a degree in Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Science. 
  My true passion lies in the art of tutoring. I find immense joy and fulfillment in imparting knowledge, 
  guiding others through their learning journeys, and witnessing the spark of understanding in their eyes.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>In my free time, I immerse myself in the world of knowledge, exploring new ways to make learning engaging 
  and enjoyable. Outside the realm of academia, I find relaxation in the harmonies of music, the narratives of 
  movies, and the thrill of games.</i>
</p>
<p>
  <i>I owe a great deal of my success and passion to the unwavering support of my loving family, who has 
  always been my rock and motivator in all my endeavors.</i>
